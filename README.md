# HomeAssistant - SamsungTV Remote Control Layout

This builds off the Remote Control layout from [Ken McElhinney](http://ken.mcelhinney.net.au/home-assistant/home-assistant-remote-control-for-my-samsung-tv-and-sonos-version-2/)

Which in turn builds off the work at https://github.com/jaruba/ha-samsungtv-tizen (Ensure this is installed first)

It creates a layout in YAML for a SamsungTV with entity_id: media_player.lounge_tv_2
